# newbooks
A horizontal content slider that reads a Sierra RSS feed and returns book covers that link to their records in the library catalog. The slider itself is based on the [Accessible Slick](https://accessible360.github.io/) project and [bldaigle's newbooks](https://github.com/bldaigle/newbooks). It uses the Google Books api for book covers

This script will create a horizontal content slider of book covers, based on a Sierra RSS feed.
